  <h2>Our site policy</h2>
  <p>For now, we do not collect any data from visitors, but since this
    site is currently hosted on GitHub Pages<a href="#href-01">[1]</a>,
    we can not guarantee that there would be no data collected by GitHub, Inc.,
    and so does jsDelivr<a href="#href-02">[2]</a> for a similar reason.
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite those facts, we're glad to tell you that for now(Apr 5th, 2021),
    those policies tell us that they only collect usage data.
    But we still recommend you check those policies<a href="#href-03">[3]</a>
    in case that they have been changed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Source codes of our site are hosted on GitHub, which are licensed under
    the MIT license, while contents on the site is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.
    You can check the link at the bottom of the sidebar for more details about the license.
  </p>
  <p>
    We may use some resources of others, but they'll be explicitly declared.
  </p>
  <!-- <p>
    TODO(Shimushu): replace those illustrations with some others that can be reposted.

  <h2>How was this site built</h2>
  <p>
    This site is built(or in another word, generated) with Jekyll<a href="#href-04">[4]</a>,
    and uses MDUI<a href="#href-05">[5]</a> as the frontend framework.
    Also, for those pages where math formulae are displayed, KaTeX<a href="#href-06">[6]</a>
    is used to render them elegantly.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, when we use them to build our site, we are bound by the licenses
    of those projects. Here you can find licenses of those projects:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll" target="_blank">Repo of Jekyll</a>, using the MIT license,</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/zdhxiong/mdui" target="_blank">Repo of MDUI</a>, using the MIT license,</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX" target="_blank">Repo of KaTeX</a>, using the MIT license.</li>
    </ul>
    Although it's not common, the projects mentioned above may alter their licenses,
    and we may not change the text above in time.
  </p>
